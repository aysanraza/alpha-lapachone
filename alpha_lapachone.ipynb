        "Introduction:\n",
        "The imbalance between energy intake and expenditure where the intake exceeds the demand or usage of energy in a human body results in the activation of adipogenesis [1]. Adipogenesis is a process where adipocytes are formed and accumulate as adipose tissue. This process can result in the formation of fat deposits at different sites in the human body [2]. The persistent formation of fat deposits results in obesity, a biological process that can cause downstream health problems, including type 2 diabetes [3].\n",

        "Alpha-Lapachone is an organic heterotricyclic compound and an organooxygen compound. Alpha-Lapachone is a natural product found in Firmiana simplex, Catalpa ovata, and other organisms [4]. The compound had been reported for having the anti-infectious activity [5].\n",

        "Beta-Lapachone is a member of the Naphthoquinones class of compounds. The naphthoquinones compounds are mostly found to have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties [6]. Recent experimentation shows beta-lapachone; a member of naphthoquinones, to have antiobesity activity [7]. Alpha-lapachone is another member of naphthoquinones class with a similar chemical constitution. There is a need to annotate alpha-lapachone against the possession of antiobesity activity. This research will broaden the scope of the chemical nature of antiobesity compounds.\n",
